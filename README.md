## Description

The system for viewing the open gym schedule can be cumbersome. With that being said, we propose the solution of an open gym schedule redesign. We created a more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface that shows information that is personalized to each user. Some of the main features include different views for days/weeks and filtering activities by sport. Revamping the open gym schedule viewer will improve the experience of the students who continue to use it.
